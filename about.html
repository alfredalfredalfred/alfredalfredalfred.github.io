                Hey! I'm a Sophomore studying Business with a concentration in Statistics at NYU. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                My interests include cooking, textiles, urban planning, tea, pedagogy, and all kinds of design.
                I enjoy making things with my hands and hope to eventually have a portfolio for physical creations.

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                I was born in Denver and moved to Charlotte before high school, and now go to school full time in New York. 

                You can reach me here at <a href = "www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-zhao-" style = "text-decoration: underline;" > LinkedIn</a>.
