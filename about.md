Hey! I'm a Sophomore studying Business with a concentration in Statistics at NYU.
<br><br>
My interests include cooking, textiles + sewing, urban planning, loose leaf tea, pedagogy, poker, technology, and all kinds of design. I enjoy making things with my hands and hope to eventually showcase some of my physical creations on this site. I was born in Denver and moved to Charlotte before high school, and now go to school full time in New York.
