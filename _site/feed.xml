<p>The motivation of this post is to augment, specify, and possibly correct our current belief systems with data obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. This type of simulation proves great for this purpose - we are not trying to publish extremely rigorous research, nor are we going to run little kids through the wringer to measure the effects of brain injury on their future development. Instead, we are going to use our common sense, a little bit of statisics, and some simple data visualization to put the risks of brain injury into the realm of “easily understandable”.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>First, what is Monte Carlo simulation? It is a way of gaining insights from real world events by specifying models that imitate these situations and running them through many, many trials. One way to understand this is as such: suppose you have a fair coin with heads and tails, and you (somehow) don’t know what the probability of heads and tails is given a completely random flip. You could approach the true probability given enough trials. That is, you flip your perfectly fair coin one thousand, one million, approaching an infinite amount of times, to eventually obtain a fifty percent chance of either heads or tails. Frankly, this is a trivial example and is not particularly enlightening nor interesting.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>However, the true beauty of Monte Carlo simulation comes from messy problems that are difficult to abstract.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Going back to the real world, the perfect game that comes to mind is poker. Say you have a given hand and flop at a table with n people all with different personalities and skillsets. While the personality and the skillset portion is accounted for entirely by your ability to read their tells, your ability to succeed in the situation is based on how closely you can approximate the Game Theory Optimal outcome in conjunction with your reads. But where does GTO even come from?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>GTO, in constrast to how poker is actually played, is “clean” and “pure”, derived entirely from the realm of computerized statistical analysis, in which Monte Carlo simulation is one of the oldest and best known tools used to solve these types of problems (although compared to modern techniques, it’s admittedly pretty clunky). One way to think about our current understanding of GTO is that we threw every tool in the book (including Monte Carlo) at every possible hand for every possible situation, recording how well each permutation does. Evidently, this paints a much better picture regarding the true chance you win a given hand, much more so than counting your outs or other simplified heuristics.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Thus, the foundation of poker play at the highest levels is simply dictated by the “truth”. <em>Which play is truly the best under all criterion in a given situation?</em> And the way that we have managed to reveal a bit of this truth has been through tools such as Monte Carlo simulation (and its much cleverer cousins).</p>

<p>Okay. So what does any of this have to do with brain injuries? Simply put, we can create a model that imitates how a typical <em>(not average!)</em> person may experience brain injuries over their lifetime. Using a “model first, inference later” thought process, we can get a pretty close approximation of how people really experience these sorts of events in their real lives using statistics such as the average number of car crashes a given person experiences in their life.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After this baseline is established, this is where things start to get more interesting. We can adjust our model along a number of dimensions such as gender, sport/position played, length of career, level of play, risk preferences, and much, more. Thus, our model will be flexible and insightful, allowing us to adjust based on the sorts of insights we want to glean.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, brain injuries and the chronic degenerative conditions that often come about as a result of them are woefully misunderstood by the general public, even as concerns about player safety and delaying the age of tackle football come more and more into the modern zeitgeist.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/placeholder-image.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/placeholder-image.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Calendar Sync</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/01/31/google-calendar-sync.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Calendar Sync" /><published>2024-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/01/31/google-calendar-sync</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/01/31/google-calendar-sync.html"><![CDATA[<p>Loading…</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loading…]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/google-calendar-app-homepage-mockup.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/google-calendar-app-homepage-mockup.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Why “Degrowth” Will Never Work</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/01/12/why-degrowth-will-never-work.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why “Degrowth” Will Never Work" /><published>2024-01-12T10:44:27-05:00</published><updated>2024-01-12T10:44:27-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/01/12/why-degrowth-will-never-work</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/01/12/why-degrowth-will-never-work.html"><![CDATA[<p>Degrowth is the policy by which economies and nations should “abandon growth of gross domestic product (GDP) as a goal, scale down destructive and unnecessary forms of production to reduce energy and material use, and focus economic activity around securing human needs and well-being” (Hickel, et. al).

<p>Most shot callers in major industries have no reasons to support degrowth. Oftentimes, their goals are diametrically opposed to this endeavor. Industries such as fossil fuels serve as good examples. They are highly traditional with long business cycles, and most players in this game have one objective - to keep their businesses running smoothly and efficiently. To ask these people to willingly play along with degrowth is absurd.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Degrowth is similarly unappealing to those that have associated rapid economic growth with prosperity. To the people that have benefitted the most from our current economic structures, asking for degrowth is akin to asking them to give up their power and wealth. When applying this mentality to political entities, we see a similar occurrence. Degrowth is impossible for empires and nations that want to maintain their spheres of influence. Modern political leaders know that might is derived from economic strength and technological sophistication.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In summary, degrowth faces a massive branding issue. It is associated with scaling down and relinquishing influence, making the idea an easy target for pundits. What then, could replace it?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Regrowth. Regrowth is a reframing; rather than scaling down, economies should “scale within”. Rather than straining public coffers via thoughtless infrastructure, we build assets that are dialed in and effective, that amortize gracefully on the balance sheet. Rather than always building new, we create repairable, backwards compatible systems. Rather than building energy infrastructure that has high levels of exposure to commodity prices, we create a resilient, diversified portfolio of options that will function regardless of supply fluctuations and geopolitical tension.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>While these thoughts are public sector thoughts, these ideas can be applied to all scalable economic systems. They illustrate the core principle of regrowth; strengthening the underlying assets that make up our economic structures: people, infrastructure, institutions, communities, and ultimately, the biosphere.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This begs the question: why would this paradigm be more palatable for corporations and business/political leaders than degrowth? Simply put, regrowth provides incentives to all stakeholders, shareholders included. While degrowth argues for a vague deceleration of growth, regrowth argues for putting our foot firmly back on the gas pedal, albeit in a radically new manner. It opts for growth that is meaningful, robust, and resilient.</p>
