    <p>Hey! Iâ€™m a Sophomore studying Business with a concentration in Statistics at NYU.</p>

<p>My interests include cooking, textiles + sewing, urban planning, loose leaf tea, pedagogy, poker, technology, and all kinds of design. I enjoy making things with my hands and hope to eventually showcase some of my physical creations on this site. I was born in Denver and moved to Charlotte before high school, and now go to school full time in New York.</p>

<p>You can reach me here at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-zhao-/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> LinkedIn</a>.</p>
