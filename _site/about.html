    <p>Hey! Iâ€™m a Sophomore studying Business with a concentration in Statistics at NYU.
<br /><br />
My interests include cooking, textiles, urban planning, tea, pedagogy, and all kinds of design. I enjoy making things with my hands and hope to eventually have a portfolio for physical creations. I was born in Denver and moved to Charlotte before high school, and now go to school full time in New York.
