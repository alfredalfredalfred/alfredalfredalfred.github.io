                Hey, I'm Alfred! I'm studying Statistics at NYU, and my interests 
                include cooking, textiles, urban planning, tea, pedagogy, and all kinds of design.

                <br>

                I like to write sometimes - my blog is below and some of my other work is in the portfolio section. Enjoy!
